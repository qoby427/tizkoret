<h1>About Tizcóret</h1>

<p>
Tizcóret helps you stay connected to the moments that matter most.<br>
It gives you clear, dependable reminders for Shabbat candle lighting and
Yahrzeit dates, so nothing meaningful is ever forgotten.
</p>

<p>
You can add Yahrzeits for family and friends, choose how you want to be
reminded, and let the app calculate the Hebrew date every year
automatically. For Shabbat, Tizcóret shows your weekly candle‑lighting
time and sends a reminder on Friday so you can prepare calmly and on time.
</p>

<p>
Tizcóret is built with care and respect for the values it supports.<br><br>
Toda raba for using Tizcóret. Shalom.<br><br>
